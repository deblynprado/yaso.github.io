						<h3 style="padding-top:0;">Work</h3>
						<p>I work for the <a href="http://w3c.br">W3C Brazil Office</a>, hosted by the Steering Internet Committee of Brazil (CGI.br). I'm responsible for researching issues around Web technologies that can change perspectives and and kickstart initiatives that foster a more open, democratic and free Internet.</p>

						<p>Previously, I worked for <a http="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html">ONU at UNDP</a> as technical consultant for innovation processes in democracy. Within this general I had the opportunity to work at the Presidency of Brazil, where I did research in design and software, and produced software mockups aiming at the creation of better digital tools for citizen participation. Also at the United Nations, I worked with <a href="https://medium.com/@yaso/some-technical-considerations-on-public-consultation-for-law-making-as-it-is-and-as-it-should-be-49c635099d94">public consultation</a> for law-making processes, regarding the Marco Civil da Internet and other related bills and laws such as Online Privacy. I don't especially love democracy, but I do believe that it's the best bet we have for now.</p>

<p>As a Designer, I made a bunch of interesting things. Two of them won the the biggest human rights prize in Brazil - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Herzog_Award">Vladimir Herzog Award</a>. I also worked with data visualization, infographics, 3D representation, jewelry & furniture design. (I'm passionate about the properties of materials.)</p>

<p>I also had the honour of being a teacher at University of Brasilia, at Industrial Design program. To see more, go to my resume to see the proper listing.</p>

<p>All the research about public participation and direct democracy that I made it's uploaded at <a href="https://brasilia.academia.edu/yasodarac%C3%B3rdova">academia.edu</a>, also in pt-br.</p>

						<h3>Epitome</h3>
						<p>My life happened immersed in extreme and unusual experiences. I grew up travelling and spent my youth divided between computers and nature, surrounded by the unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado">Cerrado bioma</a>, in Brasilia, the capital of Brasil.</p>
						<p>My father, an engineer, put me on the path towards computer programming when I was 12 teaching me some Lisp. He also taught me that things like love for freedom and the desire for subversion are within the heart, even if you are in a military garb. </p>
						<p>That's why I graduated in Industrial Design: a bit of synesthesia, curiosity and the need to reproduce mixed impressions gathered in different experiences in tangible interfaces, from furniture and industrial machines to websites - this took me to where I am now.</p>
						<p>I strongly believe that technology exists for change, but only if it is  continuus. The way we interact with each other and with machines is decisive to our future.</p>
						<p>This is a world that needs to be more equal and responsible (and maybe even more fun!) - tech isn't a miracle, it's part of our system.<p>

						</p>We have to take control of this system:</p>
