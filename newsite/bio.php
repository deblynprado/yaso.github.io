			<p>My life happened immersed in extreme experiences. Grow up travelling, spent my youth splitting my time between horses at the heart of Cerrado and computers in Brasilia, capital of Brazil.</p>
			<p>A father who is a civil engineer teached me how to program when I was 12. He teached me also that subversiveness and liberty are inside heart, even if you dress military clothes. </p>
			<p>I **strongly** believe that technology exists for change. We "live" in a world that needs to be more equal and responsible - tech isn't a miracle, it's a system.</p>
			<p>We have to take control of this system.</p>
