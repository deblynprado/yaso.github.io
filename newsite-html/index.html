							<h2><a href="projects.html#2014/13">2014/2013</a></h2>
							<p>Currently working for The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee <a href="http://CGI.br">(CGI.br)</a>, represented by <a href="http://NIC.br">NIC.br</a>, at <a href="http://w3c.br">W3C Brazil Office</a>, as technical leader. My role is to apply standards in software, lead innovation processes and research Web's relevant aspects that can affect Brazil's technological scenario. I also try to make software, and other tangible products that experiment Web (and somentimes not web) technologies. </p>

							<p>I'm co-chair at <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/Main_Page">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a> and member of the audit comitee of the Open Knowledge Brazil Chapter, known as <a href="http://br.okfn.org/">OKBr</a>. <p>To see details, go to <a href="resume.html">resume</a> or <a href="projects.html">projects</a></p>	


							<h2><a href="projects.html#2012/13">2012/13</a></h2>
							<p>Worked for W3C Brazil Office as Developer Relations and Web Specialist. In this role, my work was to find the best way to reach the WebDev community and build it aroud Open Data and Open Web. Thus, I conceived Hackathons, contests, meetings and workshops between communities of different circles. I organized Desarrolando America Latina, Brazil chapter, in <a href="http://2012.desarrollandoamerica.org/dal-en-brasil/">2012</a> and <a href="http://2013.desarrollandoamerica.org/dal-no-brasil/stakeholders-brasil/">2013</a>, coordinated the <a href="http://www.cgi.br/noticia/o-projeto-od4d-abre-chamada-publica-para-producao-de-artigos-e-softwares-sobre-dados-abertos/332">OD4D</a> challenge and concieved and executed <a href="http://www.decoders.w3c.br/fisl13/regulamento/">hackatons</a> around Open Data and Open Web. 
							<p>Ocasionally, to have fun, I developed the interface of some sites and coordinate coverage on social networks for two conferences that were organized by the office: the <a href="http://www2013.org">www2013</a> and the <a href="http://conferenciaweb.w3c.br/2013/">Webbr2013</a>. This caused a shift on the way that Web Interfaces were conceived at the W3C Brazil Office. It also added social participation on conferences as a prerequisite for press coverage.</p>


							<h2><a href="projects.html#2011">2011</a></h2>
							<p>Worked at <a href="Presidency of Brazil"></a> in special projects that aimed to use technology to raise citizen participation in democratic processes. One of this projects, the <a href="http://participatorio.juventude.gov.br/"> Participatório da Juventude </a> just won a prize named <a href="http://participatorio.juventude.gov.br/blog/view/238198/participatorio-ganha-premio-nacional-de-inovacao-tecnologica"> "A Rede" </a>, a national prize promoted by non-profit organizations to recognize initiatives that bring digital innovation to citizenship. The "Participatório" consists in a mix of social network and public consultation space. I developed guidelines for civic participation that covered technical, interface and mobilization aspects. To view detailed cases, go to <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a></p>

							<p>I volunteered for the <a href="http://www.dadosabertos.gov.br">Open Data</a> portal of the Federal Government of Brazil and worked with the Ministry of Planning team at the <a href="http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-e-projetos/Dados-Abertos/inda-infraestrutura-nacional-de-dados-abertos">National Infraestructure for Open Data </a>, connected with the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/countries/brazil">Open Government Partnership</a> initiative.</p>


								<h2><a href="projects.html#2010/11"></a>2010/11</h2>
								<p>Before that, I worked for the United Nations Development Programme as technical consultant in innovation processes for democracy at the <a href="http://www.justica.gov.br">Ministry of Justice.</a> My role was develop solutions for bills proposed by the Secretariat of Institutional Affairs, including public consultation and new processes for democracy mediated by software. I end up producing <a href="projects">4 public consultations</a> and guidelines that gave rise to the <a href="http://participacao.mj.gov.br">participation portal</a> of the Secretariat.</p>


								<h2><a href="projects.html#2010">2010</a></h2>
								<p>At the Ministry of Culture, I was part of the technical staff of "Cultura Digital", developing open projects for decentralization and distribution of content produced whithin the governamental context. The work was presented at the <a href="http://culturadigital.br/simposioacervosdigitais/2010/07/08/the-universe-of-digital-collections-in-19-videos/">  International Symposium of Public Policies for Digital Collections </a> and cited at the  <a href="http://pt.slideshare.net/Culturadigital/politicas-publicas-para-acervos-digitais"> final report </a> as a possible solution to integrate and distribute content between public libraries and museums of Brazil. 

								<p>Based on this project, called <a href="http://culturadigital.br/videoblog/2010/06/04/o-que-e-o-projeto-cervo/"> Cervo </a> we made prototypes for each media, like the <a href="https://www.gitorious.org/videre/videre/source/7d62b3863a0eb70bc7e7bc0f14a4122fa914ea82:frontend">Videre </a> using xmpp as a protocol to distribute media. The concepts developed at that time are being used as public policies untill today. The Ministry of Culture runs a program that aims to distribute cultural content with an open platform. </p>

								<p>Still in the Cultura Digital, I worked with the public consultation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Civil_Rights_Framework_for_the_Internet"> Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet </a> and for the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41819">Copyright Law reform.</a></p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2009">2009</a></h2>
								<p>As technical coordinator of a developer team at <a href="EBC">Brazil Communication Company </a>[EBC], I spent the year working with alternative protocols to distribute and federate multimedia content. We used a daily journal from TV to generate a prototype of a platform called (pt-br) <a href="http://ingraxa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/w3c_ReporterBrasil1.pdf"> Jarvis </a>. It turned out to be a seed that was later watered in the Digital Culture Secreatariat of the Ministry of Culture. </p>
								<p>I also worked with journalists in a multimedia story that won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Herzog_Award">Vladimir Herzog </a> <a href="http://www.premiovladimirherzog.org.br/busca-resultado-integra.asp?cd_trabalho=397"> prize </a> for Amnesty and Human Rights in it's 31 edition, in the Internet category. It was the second time that we won this prize. </p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2008">2008</a></h2>
								<p>As UX Designer and Web developer I worked with multimedia content and was part of the team that won, for the 1st time at a public news agency, the most important prize in journalism and human rights in Brasil, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Herzog_Award">Vladimir Herzog Prize prize for Amnesty and Human Rights</a>, with an multimedia story about the "Quilombolas". My role was to design and develop the platform and infographics for these two pieces. I edited some video too, just for *fun*.</p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2007">2007</a></h2>
								<p>As user experience, user interface designer and Flash Developer (who didn't code ActionScript before HTML5? :-D) I worked with datavis and infographic pieces for the Agência Brazil, which was the public news agency of Radiobras (an equivalent to <a href="http://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>) .</p>
								<p>In this role I worked with non linear narratives, digital storytelling, hipervideo experiences, data visualization and infographics. Some projects are at the <a href="projects.html#infografia">projects</a> page. Others were lost, because they offended the government with contrary positions, such as the multimedia storytelling about the power plants on the <a href="projects.html#riomadeira"> Madeira </a> River.</p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2006">2006</a></h2>
								<p>My 1st job for the government, working for the public news agency of Brazil, called Radiobras, as Interface Designer and FrontEnd for the new online news agency. We made it using Open Source Software and Creative Commons Licences for the 1st time in Brazil. To see the project detailed, go to <a href="projects.html#agencia">projects</a> page.</p>
								<p>In parallel, I worked for small companies of Internet infrastrucure sector as a consultant on Digital Marketing strategy. At <a href="http://redecom.com/"> Redecomm </a>, a small company in the heart of Brasilia, I have conducted the company's strategic planning, using methodologies like Domain Drive Design. The company won a prize entrepreneurship given by University of Brasilia in 2006. This experience deserves citation here because It was fundamental for my later work to see the business word thru an entrepreneur eyes. This demystified that usual view that business are always bad. </p>
								<h2><a href="projects.html#before">Before all</a></h2>								<p>Before 2006 I was AutoCad freelancer and worked for independent engineers in Brazil and Europe. My favorite projects were metal structures, boats and big bridges. I also worked with AutoCad for the jewerly artisan and artist <a href="http://www.clementinaduarte.com.br/en/designer.html">Clementina Duarte</a>, and for my own father, a great engineer. I used to make some scientific illustrations as freelancer too.</p>
