							<p>Currently working for The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee <a href="http://CGI.br">CGI.br</a>, represented by <a href="http://NIC.br">NIC.br</a>, at <a href="http://w3c.br">W3C Brazil Office</a>, as technical leader. My role is to apply standards in software, lead innovation processes and, research Web's relevant aspects that can affect Brazil's technological scenario. I also try to make software, and other tangible products that experiment new technologies. </p>

							<p>I'm co-chair at <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/Main_Page">Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group</a> and <p>Member of the audit comitee of the Open Knowledge Brazil Chapter, known as <a href="http://br.okfn.org/">OKBr</a>. <p>To see details, go to <a href="resume.html">resume</a>or <a href="projects.html">projects</a></p>	


							<h2><a href="projects.html#2012/13">2012/13</a></h2>
							<p>Worked for W3C Brazil Office as Developer Relations and Web Specialist. In this role, my work was to find the best practices to make the community development and build it aroud Open Data and Open Web. Thus, I conceived Hackathons, contests, meetings and workshops between communities of different circles. I organized Desarrolando America Latina, Brazil chapter, in <a href="http://2012.desarrollandoamerica.org/dal-en-brasil/">2012</a> and <a href="http://2013.desarrollandoamerica.org/dal-no-brasil/stakeholders-brasil/">2013</a>, coordinated the <a href="http://www.cgi.br/noticia/o-projeto-od4d-abre-chamada-publica-para-producao-de-artigos-e-softwares-sobre-dados-abertos/332">OD4D</a> challenge and concieved and executed <a href="http://www.decoders.w3c.br/fisl13/regulamento/">hackatons</a> around Open Data and Open Web. I also developed the interface of some sites and coordinate coverage on social networks for two conferences that were organized by the office: the <a href="http://www2013.org">www2013</a> and the <a href="http://conferenciaweb.w3c.br/2013/">Webbr2013</a>. 
								This caused a shift on the way that Web Interfaces are conceived at the W3C Brazil Office. It also added social participation on conferences as a prerequisite for press coverage.</p>


								<h2><a href="projects.html#2011">2011</a></h2>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2010/11"></a>2010/11</h2>
								<p>Before that, I worked for the United Nations Development Programme as technical consultant in innovation processes for democracy at the <a href="http://www.justica.gov.br">Ministry of Justice.</a> My role was develop solutions for bills proposed by the Secretariat of Institutional Affairs, including public consultation and new processes for democracy mediated by software.

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2010">2010</a></h2>
								<p>Worked for the Ministry of Culture, as part of the technical staff of "Cultura Digital", developing open projects for decentralization and distribution of content produced whithin the governamental context. In this circumstances we produced prototypes like <a href="Cervo">Cervo</a> and <a href="videre">Videre</a>, both projects of public libraries distributed in federated servers using xmpp as a protocol to distribute media. Also, the team made the public consultation for the <a href="marco civil">Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet</a> and for the <a href="direito Autoral consulta">Copyright Law reform.</a></p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2009">2009</a></h2>
								<p>As technical coordinator of a developer team at <a href="EBC">Brazil Communication Company </a>[EBC], I spent the year working with alternative protocols to distribute and federate multimedia content. We used a daily journal from TV to generate a prototype of a platform called <a href="jarvis">Jarvis</a>. It turned out to be a seed that was later watered in the Digital Culture Secreatariat of the Ministry of Culture. </p>
								<p>Ocasionally we made some <a href="projetos.html#websites"></a>websites and I worked with journalists in a multimedia story that won the <a href="projetos.html#vladimir1">Vladimir Herzog</a> prize for Amnesty and Human Rights in it's 31 edition, in the Internet category. </p>

My role was to design and develop the platform and infographics for these two pieces. I edited some video too, just for *fun*.</p>

								<h2><a href="projects.html#2007">2007</a></h2>

								<p>In this role I worked with non linear narratives, digital storytelling, hipervideo experiences, data visualization and infographics. Some projects are at the <a href="projects.html#infografia">projects</a> page. Others were lost, because they offended the government with contrary positions, such as the multimedia storytelling about the power plants on the <a href="projects.html#riomadeira">Madeira</a> River.</p>
