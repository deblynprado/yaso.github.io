	<h3>Epitome</h3>
	<p>My life happened immersed in extreme and unusual experiences. Grow up travelling, spent my youth splitting my time between the nature at the heart of the unique bioma called Cerrado and computers in Brasilia, capital of Brazil.</p>
	<p>My father, an engineer, put me on the path to programming when I was 12, teaching me some Lisp. He also taught me that things like love for freedom and the desire for subversion are within the heart, even if you are in a military garb. </p>
	<p>And then I graduated in Industrial Design: a bit of synesthesia, curiosity and the need to reproduce mixed impressions gathered in different experiences at tangible interfaces, from furniture and industrial machines to websites - and it took me to where I am now.</p>
	<p>I strongly believe that technology exists for change, but only if it is continuum. The way we interact with each other and with machines is decisive to our future as humans.</p>
	<p>This world needs to be more equal, responsible (and fun!) - tech isn't a miracle, it's part of our system.<p>
	</p>We have to (re)take control of this system</p>
