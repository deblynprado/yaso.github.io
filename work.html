	<p>Working to W3C Brazil Office, which is hosted by the Steering Internet Committee of Brazil, I'm responsible for research and practice issues around the Web technology that can change views and start actions toward a more open, democratic and free Internet.</p>

	<p>Before I worked for UNESCO as a consultant for innovation processes in democracy. At the presidency, I produced research, design and software mockup to point paths to achieve better digital tools for citizen participation. Also with the United Nations, I worked with public consultation, in law-making processes, for the Marco Civil da Internet, Data Privacy among others. I don't especially like democracy, but I do believe that it's the best bet we have for change everything.</p>

	<p>And, as a Designer, I made a bunch of beautiful things. Two of them won the biggest human rights prize of Brazil - the Vladimir Herzog Award. Worked with dataViz, Infographic and jewels (yes, that!) and furniture. I'm passionate by the properties of certain materials. </p>
