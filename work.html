	<p>Working to W3C Brazil Office, which is hosted by the <a href="http://cgi.org">Steering Internet Committee of Brazil</a>, I'm responsible for research Web technologies that can change views and start actions toward a more open, democratic and free Internet.</p>

	<p>In my previous job I worked for UNESCO as a consultant for innovation processes in democracy, at the PNUD project. In this position I could contribute at the Presidency of Brazil, where I produced research, design and software mockup to show paths to achieve better digital tools for citizen participation. Also with the United Nations, I worked with public consultation, in law-making processes, for the Marco Civil da Internet, Data Privacy among others, at the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Culture and others. I don't especially like democracy, but I do believe that it's the best bet we have for change everything.</p>

	<p>In my early days of official work I made a bunch of interesting things at journalism and datavis. Two of them won the biggest human rights prize of Brazil - the Vladimir Herzog Award (at 2009 and 2008). I also worked with dataViz, Infographic, jewels (yes, that!) and furniture. If you want to, see here the detailed descriptions of some good jobs delivered by me for the last 10 years.</p>
