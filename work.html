	<p>Working to W3C Brazil Office, which is hosted by the <a href="http://cgi.org">Steering Internet Committee of Brazil</a>, I'm responsible for research Web technologies that can change views and start actions toward a more open, democratic and free Internet.</p>

	<p>In my previous job I worked for UNESCO as a consultant for innovation processes in democracy, at the <a href="http://www.undp.org/">United Nations Development Programme</a> project. In this position I could contribute at the Presidency of Brazil, where I produced research, design and software mockup to show paths to achieve better digital tools for citizen participation. Also with the United Nations, I worked with public consultation, in law-making processes, for the Marco Civil da Internet, Data & Privacy, Digital Rights and others, at the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Culture and so on so forth. I don't especially like democracy, but I do believe that it's the best bet we have for change everything.</p>

	<p>In my early days of official work I made a bunch of interesting things at journalism and datavis. Two of them won the biggest human rights prize of Brazil - the Vladimir Herzog Award (at 2009 and 2008). I also worked with dataViz, Infographic, jewels (yes, that!) and furniture. If you want to, see <a href="Work_complete.html">here</a> the detailed descriptions of some good jobs delivered by me for the last 10 years.</p>
